Quartz Composer Compositions

OpenCL						Composition examples that use OpenCL patch.

Sample Requirements				The supplied Quartz Composer compositions were created 
						using the Quartz Composer editor running under Mac OS X 
						10.6.x or later and requires OpenCL-capable hardware.

About the sample				Compositions that demonstrate the use of OpenCL patch in 
						Quartz Composer. OpenCL takes full advantage of the 
						computing ability of the parallel processors, such as 
						multi-core CPUs, GPUs or Cell, and provides high 
						performance for the processing of large data set.

Using the Sample				Open the compositions using the Quartz Composer editor 
						which can be found in /Developer/Applications. Some of
						the samples make use of Virtual Patches. The source for
						those can be found in the included "Quartz Composer 
						Patches" and will install when opened.
